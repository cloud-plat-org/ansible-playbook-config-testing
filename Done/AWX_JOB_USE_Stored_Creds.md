You're absolutely right! We went through all that credential configuration specifically to avoid passwordless sudo. Let me show you the proper way to do this.

**The Issue:** Ansible can't handle interactive prompts, but we can configure it to use the stored credentials non-interactively.

**The Better Solution:**

1. **Remove the interactive password prompts from AWX:**
   ```bash
# Get job template ID by name
JOB_TEMPLATE_ID=$(awx --conf.host https://localhost -k --conf.token "$AWX_TOKEN" job_template list | jq -r '.results[] | select(.name == "Stop Services WSL") | .id')
echo "Job Template ID: $JOB_TEMPLATE_ID"

# List all job templates with their IDs
awx --conf.host https://localhost -k --conf.token "$AWX_TOKEN" job_template list | jq '.results[] | {id, name}'

# Check current job template settings
awx --conf.host https://localhost -k --conf.token "$AWX_TOKEN" job_template get "$JOB_TEMPLATE_ID" | jq '{ask_credential_on_launch, ask_variables_on_launch}'

# Modify the job template
awx --conf.host https://localhost -k --conf.token "$AWX_TOKEN" job_template modify "$JOB_TEMPLATE_ID" --ask_credential_on_launch false

# Check current job template settings
awx --conf.host https://localhost -k --conf.token "$AWX_TOKEN" job_template get 9 | jq '{ask_credential_on_launch, ask_variables_on_launch}'
```

2. **Configure the job template to use stored credentials:**
   ```bash
   # Set the job template to use stored credentials (not ask on launch)
   awx --conf.host https://localhost -k --conf.token "$AWX_TOKEN" job_template modify 9 --ask_credential_on_launch false
   ```

3. **Update the playbook to use environment variables that AWX provides:**
   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Stop services on Ubuntu
     hosts: all_servers
     gather_facts: true
     become: true
     become_method: sudo
     become_user: daniv
     environment:
       ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASSWORD: "{{ ansible_become_password }}"
     tasks:
       - name: Stop service using systemctl command
         command: systemctl stop {{ service_name }}
         become: true
         register: stop_result
         ignore_errors: true
   ```

4. **Or use the `ansible.builtin.systemd` module with proper configuration:**
   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Stop services on Ubuntu
     hosts: all_servers
     gather_facts: true
     become: true
     become_method: sudo
     become_user: daniv
     tasks:
       - name: Stop service using systemd module
         ansible.builtin.systemd:
           name: "{{ service_name }}"
           state: stopped
         become: true
   ```

**The key is configuring AWX to use stored credentials instead of interactive prompts.** This is the secure way we were working toward!

Would you like to try this approach instead of passwordless sudo?
